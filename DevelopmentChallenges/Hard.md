# Hard Development Challenges 
## Player Profiles
**Skills:** Scripting, User Interface

Player profiles are an excellent way to draw your players into your game. Profiles can store achievements, customization unlocks, friends, etc. In Super Space Shooter, the player profile challenge would lay the ground work for future enhancements to occur. That means that it would handle connecting to a service or local database in order to store information. The remaining 'hard' challenges will use this feature in order to fully function.

## Achievements
**Skills:** Scripting, User Interface

Achievements are a very common component of video games. With Super Space Shooter, players could earn achievements for attacking a certain amount and/or type of enemy. For example, there could be three achievments around killing a "Small Enemy" unlocked at the 10, 50 and 100 kill mark.

## Ship Customization
**Skills:** Scripting, User Interface

There's only one player ship and weapon combination available to players. This could be expanded to let players choose the color, model and weapon combination for their ship. If this feature was integrated with the Player Profile and Achievement challenges, it could be enhanced to unlock new customization skins based on when an achievement has been earned.

## Leaderboard
**Skills:** Scripting, User Interface

Players earn points based on the amount of enemies that they have killed. Once they die, their information should be logged into a leaderboard. This logic could be based off of whether or not they made the top X of the list or it could be a long running history.
