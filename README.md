Super Space Shooter is a Unity demo game showing simple mechanics such as audio, animations, AI and UI. The purpose of this project is to give beginner developers a stepping stone into creating their own games. Videos showing how Super Space Shooter was created from the beginning can be found here:

I'd love to see what you've created with the development challenges or on your own! Tweet them to [@yecats131](https://twitter.com/yecats131).

## Development Challenges

Super Space Shooter is a bare bones game that has many opportunities to be extended and enhanced to draw players in. Development challenges are designed to get new developers used to breaking down a large problem (making a game) into smaller, bite sized chunks. It is important to note that the challenges are not meant to be step-by-step instructions on how to solve a problem in Unity but instead encourage research and experimentation. By the end of the challenges you'll have a complete space shooter game with better visuals, power ups, customizations, player profiles and AI improvements.

*Note: Some challenges may depend on another being completed. For example, adding achievements depend on a player profile.*
